# How to use this Repo

If you want to run all the tests of this repository,
copy the `.babelrc` and `package.json` file from the `1-installing-jest` folder
into the root folder.

Then add `jest` to the project:

```
yarn add jest && yarn install
```

Then you are good to run `jest` directly.

```
yarn test
# or
yarn jest
```
